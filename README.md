# Email-Classification

Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that automatically classifies email messages as spam (unwanted messages) or ham (legitimate messages). The dataset contains thousands of email text samples along with a binary label indicating whether each message is spam (1) or not (0).

To achieve this, the following steps will be performed:

Explore and understand the dataset (size, class distribution, basic statistics)

Clean and preprocess the email text (remove noise, normalize text)

Convert text into meaningful numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix

Select the best-performing model for accurate spam detection

Effective spam classification helps improve productivity and security by automatically filtering out unwanted or harmful emails.
